                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello! I'm Samia, an A-Level student passionate about Data Science. I am currently studying Computer Science, Business and Chemistry at The Compton Sixthform. My journey into the technology field began with me not knowing what to pick to study at A-Level, so I took it upon myself to research all kinds of careers. This lead me to pick studying Computer Science, with some persuasion from my sister, as she knew much more than me. </p>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading books that my friends have recommended to me. I am excited to bring my skills and passion into real-world projects as I'm always looking for ways to learn and grow.</p>
