                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello! I'm Samia, an A-Level student passionate about Data Science. I am currently studying Computer Science, Business and Chemistry at The Compton Sixthform. My journey into the technology field began with me not knowing what to pick to study at A-Level, so I took it upon myself to research all kinds of careers. This lead me to pick studying Computer Science, with some persuasion from my sister, as she knew much more than me. Today, I am beyond glad that I took that route and allowed myself to pick a career that I am interested in. </p>
                <p>In my free time, I like to read books that my friends have recommended to me. I also genuinely enjoy programming small and large projects, as it fills me with a sense of accomplishment and confidence. I am excited to bring my skills and passion into real-world projects as I'm always looking for ways to learn and grow.</p>

            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p> I started my journey in technology with a curiosity about how things work. My first experience coding was printing "Hello World", however my first programing project that I decided to do was a noughts and crosses program. This was after learning the basics of python where I knew I had to implement my skill to refine and elevate my programming techniques. As I wasn't familiar with any coding language it was quite hard for me to keep up in lesson, as I was the only one who hadn't done computer science GCSE. This really brought my motivation down and almost made me drop the subject as a whole, however I buckled down and continued trying my best. Finally, I saw my grades slowing climbing up and so did my confidence in the course. After researching many careers in the industry by attending webinars, reaching out to people on social media and conducting my own research, I realised I needed to make myself more appealing and well-rounded in my knowledge. This lead me to start courses on SQL in Data Science, Excel, Software Development and Business Analysis. I really enjoy where I am at right now but also excited for what there is to come. Since then, I have been driven to learn more and progess alongside technology.</p>
